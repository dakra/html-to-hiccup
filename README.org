#+TITLE: html-to-hiccup

Emacs package that turns HTML into Hiccup syntax, a notation popular when doing
Clojure/ClojureScript web development.

* Installation

** use-package (recommended)

If you're using [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] then just drop this snippet in your
~.emacs.d/init.el~. Change the keybinding to something more practical.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package html-to-hiccup
    :ensure t
    :config
    (define-key clojure-mode-map (kbd "H-h") 'html-to-hiccup-convert-region))
#+END_SRC

** MELPA

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (package-initialize)           ;; you probably don't need to initialize + refresh
  (package-refresh-contents)     ;; but it won't hurt
  (package-install 'html-to-hiccup)
#+END_SRC

** From Github

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone https://github.com/plexus/html-to-hiccup.git
cd html-to-hiccup
cp html-to-hiccup.el ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC

* Usage

Require ~html-to-hiccup~, select a snippet of HTML, and do ~M-x
html-to-hiccup-convert-region~. This package does not come with a default
keybinding, you're free to bind it to whatever key combo you like.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'html-to-hiccup)

(define-key clojure-mode-map (kbd "H-h") 'html-to-hiccup-convert-region)
#+END_SRC

If you're using CIDER, a cool thing to do is to call `cider-format-edn-region`
on the region after conversion.

* Example

Turns this

#+BEGIN_SRC html
  <div id="thing">
    <span class="important">Enjoy your lemonade</span>
  </div>
#+END_SRC

into this

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  [:div#thing [:span.important "Enjoy your lemonade"]]
#+END_SRC

* Attribution

I had an earlier, hacky version of this code lying around before. Jack Rusher
was so kind to clean it up and give me feedback during EuroClojure 2016. Thanks,
Jack! It seemed a waste not to put it on MELPA after that.
